Beautiful Soup - plugin for Sublime Text 3
==========================================

This plugin allows to use the [Beautiful Soup beautifier](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to indent html code with Sublime Text 3.

This is an update to the [previous version](https://github.com/ivanchaer/beautiful-soup-sublime).

The key binding "ctrl+k","ctrl+j" is set to trigger the plugin.
